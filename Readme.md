# Code Kitchen 1

Small experiment in three hours: https://www.meetup.com/CreativeCodeParis/events/265267716/

I wanted to test [luminance](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs) and synchronizing shaders with sound from [SuperCollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/).

Requirements:

- Latest stable rust.
- Latest supercollider.

Run:

1. Build and run the visual part with `cargo run`.
1. Open *audio.scd* and press `Ctrl`+`Enter` to run the audio part. You should see `Ready!` in the console.
1. Press `Space` on the visual app.
